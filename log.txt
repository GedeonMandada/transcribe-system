so this is what i have done. i access https://sermon-api-aqtq.onrender.com/
then i clicked the view sermons button link, which now redirected me to https://sermon-api-aqtq.onrender.com/sermons.html
now, once i am redirected here, i made sure to have my network tab open to see all requests.
from what i have observed, there was a pending request of GET https://sermon-api-aqtq.onrender.com/api/sermons
this lasted about 33 seconds before it eventually gave 502 status code

Request URL
https://sermon-api-aqtq.onrender.com/api/sermons
Request Method
GET
Status Code
502 Bad Gateway

Then i checked the console log for any error, and thats when i saw this error

sermons.html:18 
 GET https://sermon-api-aqtq.onrender.com/api/sermons 502 (Bad Gateway)
 error message: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 502 ()
 code:
 fetch('/api/sermons')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(sermons => {
        sermons.forEach(sermon => {
          const sermonCard = `
            <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
              <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 truncate" title="${sermon.id}">${sermon.id}</h2>
              <a href="/sermon.html?id=${sermon.id}" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">View Sermon</a>
            </div>
          `;
          sermonList.innerHTML += sermonCard;
        });
      });


Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input

    error message: Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input
    code:

      .then(response => response.json())

            </div>
          `;
          sermonList.innerHTML += sermonCard;
        });
      });



WHAT I WANT
in the api/sermons route, we should be simply fetching the saved json files in cloudflare r2 storage and display them on the page.
i do not know why this is failing.
